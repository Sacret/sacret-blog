I made an English-to-Russian translation of a great article by [Lin Clark](https://twitter.com/linclark), "A cartoon guide to Flux". It is available [here](https://medium.com/russian/%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D0%BE-flux-%D0%B2-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%85-d59c03562ea).

Lin was so nice to let me translate her original article. I hope it will help the Russian-speaking community.
