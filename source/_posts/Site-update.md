I am happy to announce that I've updated my site with [Hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) blog framework and [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak) theme. It's been a while since I updated it last time several years ago.

The first one I made with pure HTML/CSS/JS. It had "pinky" childish design with butterflies and manga girls:

The second was made using Drupal 7 and Bootstrap theme:
